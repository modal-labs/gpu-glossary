title: What is register pressure?
---

Register pressure is a colorful term used when the [register file](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file) is a [bottleneck](https://www.notion.so/GPU-Performance-Glossary-2251e7f1694980bd93e4f67a75c6e489?pvs=21).

[Registers](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/registers) in the [Parallel Thread eXecution (PTX)](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/parallel-thread-execution) language are virtual and unlimited, but the [register files](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file) of the [Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor) are physical and so limited.

The amount of space in the [register file](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file) consumed by a [thread](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread) is determined by the [Streaming ASSembler (SASS)](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/streaming-assembler) code for the [kernel](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel), and since all [threads](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread) in a [thread block](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) are scheduled onto the same [SM](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor), the total space required by a [thread block](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) is determined also by the [kernel](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) launch configuration. As the space allocated per [thread block](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) increases, fewer [thread blocks](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) can be scheduled onto the same [SM](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor), reducing [occupancy](https://www.notion.so/GPU-Performance-Glossary-2251e7f1694980bd93e4f67a75c6e489?pvs=21) and making it more difficult to [hide latency](https://www.notion.so/GPU-Performance-Glossary-2251e7f1694980bd93e4f67a75c6e489?pvs=21).

See [this excellent article by SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/06/23/nvidia-tensor-core-evolution-from-volta-to-blackwell/) for an account of the relationship between register pressure and key features added in recent [Streaming Multiprocessor architectures](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor-architecture), like asynchronous copies (added in Ampere), the [Tensor Memory Accelerator](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-memory-accelerator) (TMA, added in Hopper), and [tensor memory](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-memory) (added in Blackwell).

Register pressure also occurs in CPUs, where similar register [bottlenecks](https://www.notion.so/GPU-Performance-Glossary-2251e7f1694980bd93e4f67a75c6e489?pvs=21) limit the degree to which loops can be [strip-mined during auto-vectorization](https://hogback.atmos.colostate.edu/rr/old/tidbits/intel/macintel/doc_files/source/extfile/optaps_for/common/optaps_vec_mine.htm).
