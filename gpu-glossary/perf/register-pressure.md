title: What is register pressure?
---

Register pressure is a colorful term used when the [register file](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file) is a [bottleneck](/gpu-glossary/perf/performance-bottleneck).

[Registers](/gpu-glossary/device-software/registers) in the [Parallel Thread eXecution (PTX)](/gpu-glossary/device-software/parallel-thread-execution) language are virtual and unlimited, but the [register files](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file) of the [Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor) are physical and so limited.

The amount of space in the [register file](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file) consumed by a [thread](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread) is determined by the [Streaming ASSembler (SASS)](/gpu-glossary/device-software/streaming-assembler) code for the [kernel](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel), and since all [threads](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread) in a [thread block](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) are scheduled onto the same [SM](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor), the total space required by a [thread block](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) is determined also by the [kernel](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) launch configuration. As the space allocated per [thread block](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) increases, fewer [thread blocks](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) can be scheduled onto the same [SM](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor), reducing [occupancy](/gpu-glossary/perf/occupancy) and making it more difficult to [hide latency](/gpu-glossary/perf/latency-hiding).

See [this excellent article by SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/06/23/nvidia-tensor-core-evolution-from-volta-to-blackwell/) for an account of the relationship between register pressure and key features added in recent [Streaming Multiprocessor architectures](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor-architecture), like asynchronous copies (added in Ampere), the [Tensor Memory Accelerator](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-memory-accelerator) (TMA, added in Hopper), and [tensor memory](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-memory) (added in Blackwell).

Register pressure also occurs in CPUs, where similar register [bottlenecks](/gpu-glossary/perf/performance-bottleneck) limit the degree to which loops can be [strip-mined during auto-vectorization](https://hogback.atmos.colostate.edu/rr/old/tidbits/intel/macintel/doc_files/source/extfile/optaps_for/common/optaps_vec_mine.htm).
