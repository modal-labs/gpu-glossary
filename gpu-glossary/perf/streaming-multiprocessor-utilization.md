title: What is SM utilization?
---

SM utilization measures the percentage of time that [Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor) are executing instructions.

SM utilization is akin to the more familiar [kernel utilization](https://modal.com/blog/gpu-utilization-guide) reported by [`nvidia-smi`](/gpu-glossary/host-software/nvidia-smi), but more fine-grained. Instead of reporting the fraction of time that a [kernel](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) is executing anywhere on the GPU, it reports the fraction of time all [SMs](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor) spend executing [kernels](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel). If a [kernel](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) uses only one [SM](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor), e.g. because it only has one [thread block](/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block), then it will achieve 100% GPU utilization while it is active, but the SM utilization will be at most one over the number of [SMs](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor) â€” under 1% in an H100 GPU.

[As with GPU utilization but unlike CPU utilization](https://modal.com/blog/gpu-utilization-guide), SM utilization should be high, even up to 100%.

But even though SM utilization is finer-grained than GPU utilization, it still isn't fine-grained enough to capture how well the GPU's compute resources are being used. If SM utilization is high, but performance is still inadequate, programmers should check [pipe utilization](https://www.notion.so/GPU-Performance-Glossary-2251e7f1694980bd93e4f67a75c6e489?pvs=21), which measures how effectively each SM uses its internal functional units. High SM utilization with low [pipe utilization](https://www.notion.so/GPU-Performance-Glossary-2251e7f1694980bd93e4f67a75c6e489?pvs=21) indicates that your [kernel](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) is running on many SMs but not fully utilizing the computational resources within each one.
