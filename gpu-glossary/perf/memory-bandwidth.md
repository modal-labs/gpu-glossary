title: What is memory bandwidth?
---

Memory bandwidth is the maximum rate at which data can be transferred between
different levels of the
[memory hierarchy](/gpu-glossary/device-software/memory-hierarchy).

It represents the theoretical maximum achievable throughput for moving data in
bytes per second. It determines the slope of the "memory roof" in a
[roofline model](/gpu-glossary/perf/roofline-model) of the hardware.

There are many memory bandwidths in a complete system — one between each level
of the [memory hierarchy](/gpu-glossary/device-software/memory-hierarchy).

The most important bandwidth is that between the
[GPU RAM](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/gpu-ram) and the
[register files](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file) of the
[Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor),
because the [working sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set_size) of
most [kernels](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) only fit in
[GPU RAM](/gpu-glossary/device-software/memory-hierarchy), not anywhere higher
up in the [memory hierarchy](/gpu-glossary/device-software/memory-hierarchy). It
is for this reason that that bandwidth is the primary one used in
[roofline modeling](/gpu-glossary/perf/roofline-model) of GPU
[kernel](/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) performance.

Contemporary GPUs have memory bandwidths measured in terabytes per second. For
example, [B200 GPUs](https://modal.com/blog/introducing-b200-h200) have a
(bidirectional) memory bandwidth of 8 TB/sec to their HBM3e memory. This is much
lower than the [arithmetic bandwidth](/gpu-glossary/perf/arithmetic-bandwidth)
of the [Tensor Cores](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-core) in these GPUs,
leading to increased [ridge point](/gpu-glossary/perf/roofline-model)
[arithmetic intensity](/gpu-glossary/perf/arithmetic-intensity).

Representative bandwidth numbers for NVIDIA data center GPUs between the Ampere
and Blackwell
[Streaming Multiprocessor architectures](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor-architecture)
are listed in the table below.
