title: What is an active cycle?
---

An active cycle is a clock cycle in which a [Streaming Multiprocessor](/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor) has at least one [active warp](/gpu-glossary/perf/FIXME) resident. The [warp](/gpu-glossary/device-software/warp) may be [eligible](/gpu-glossary/perf/FIXME) or [stalled](/gpu-glossary/perf/FIXME).
